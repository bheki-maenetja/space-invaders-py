## Overview
The game is a pythonic implementation of the popular arcade game Space Invaders. When the game begins, the player has to shoot down multiple waves of aliens that approach with increasing speed. The player moves their spacecraft with the left and right arrow keys whilst firing bullets with the spacebar. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the aliens whilst losing as few lives as possible. Points are awarded for each alien kill and bonus points are awarded for each mothership that is destroyed.

## Development
## Reflection
## Future Features
- **Menu:** the game features a rudimentary menu with only two buttons and basic information about the most recent match. In the next update I would like to create a more expansive menu where users can configure settings for their matches and view their record for all the matches that they have played.
- **Power Ups:** for the next update I will allow for the user to attain 'power ups' that can provide temporary enhancements to the user's gameplay. These enchaments may include increased fire rate, protection from bombs or reinforcement ships that can help the user take on the aliens.
